    description: I like to solve problems and think about the future
    text: >-
      I graduated in digital design, working for over 20 years as a freelancer
      in design, development, and brand identity.\

      \

      I like to have a systemic approach to problem solving, and I’m always studying what is new in the field of technology.\

      \

      **Main expertise:**\

      \

      Design of interfaces using the best practices of UI/UX and applying the concept of design tokens for scalable development in different platforms/products.\

      \

      Creation of custom websites using WordPress as a backend for fast and efficient results.


      **Currently studying:**\

      \

      I see three pillars for the future of web design:


      1. Design tokens as an expression of one source of truth, even within small teams (Style Dictionary).

      2. Decoupling front and backend, using headless CMS’s (Strapi and other headless CMS’s)

      3. Blazing fast frontends and minimal. (Svelte, Astro)
