description: "WordPress is a monster: it powers more than 40% of the world's
  internet, it's versatile, easy to use and has great support. Over time,
  however, some of his qualities became sources of trouble. Here I discuss some
  of the pros and cons of the platform, which in my opinion has lost its
  universal appeal for developers."
